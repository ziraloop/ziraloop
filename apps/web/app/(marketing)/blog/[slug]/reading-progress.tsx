/**
 * Fixed-position progress bar that tracks how far the reader has scrolled
 * through the page. Lives in its own client component so the slug page can
 * stay a server component (and keep its static-generation properties via
 * generateStaticParams).
 *
 * Why direct DOM ref mutation instead of React state:
 *
 * Going through React's state → reconciliation → commit pipeline adds
 * milliseconds of visible lag on every scroll event, which makes the bar
 * feel like it's chasing the cursor instead of being glued to it. Writing
 * directly to `ref.current.style.width` skips React entirely and updates
 * the DOM in microseconds.
 *
 * Why no CSS transition:
 *
 * A CSS `transition: width Xms` smooths the width animation over X
 * milliseconds, which means even after the value updates instantly the
 * browser is still animating it. That's the lag you feel. The transition
 * is removed so each frame's width is the exact current scroll position,
 * not an interpolation toward it.
 *
 * Why rAF coalescing:
 *
 * Scroll events fire faster than the screen refreshes, especially on
 * touchpads with smooth scrolling. requestAnimationFrame collapses
 * multiple events into one update per browser frame, which is the
 * physical maximum update rate the user can perceive anyway. Without
 * rAF you'd be doing redundant DOM writes that the browser would just
 * batch and discard.
